I made a 3-D version of the 1981 arcade game Bosconian. You can play it
[here](https://nolannicholson.com/bosco-3d).

# Backstory

When I was ten years old or so, my parents bought me one of these things
from Bed Bath & Beyond:

It had five games on it: Pac-Man, Galaxian, Dig-Dug, Rally-X, and Bosconian. I
think we bought it just for Pac-Man and Galaxian, and I hadn't even heard of the
other three games. But I would end up spending more hours on Bosconian than the
other four combined.

Bosconian is a top-down scrolling arcade shooter. The goal is to destroy enemy
bases placed throughout each level, while avoiding obstacles and enemies. If
you've never played it, [here's a video of some
gameplay](https://youtu.be/EJcCGYERHIc).

The game did not do great commercially: in fact, a lot of Bosconian cabinets
were sent back to be converted into Galaga cabinets.  But Bosconian had a few
unique things about it.  For one, the arcade version could play back real-life
voice recordings, though the playback was choppy and distorted.

For another thing - and this is what hooked me: unlike Galaga, Gradius, and most
other arcade spacey-shooty games, which carry you along a linear path, the
levels in Bosconian are open worlds where you can fly in any direction. This
made Bosconian feel more like a real, physical place than most other games I've
played. It was an open-world game before that was really a thing!

So, in a love letter to Bosconian and its openness, I did the only thing I could
do to make it even more open. I made a 3-D version.

# JavaScript + WebGL

Instead of using a game engine or framework like Unity or Three.js, I decided to
make this game "from scratch" in plain JavaScript, using WebGL for graphics.

I wanted the game to be widely accessible and easy to try, and WebGL is hard to
beat for that: most web browsers can run it, so you don't need to download a
stand-alone app. (This accessibility could be a disadvantage if you are selling
your game and concerned about piracy, but I'm obviously not selling this game
any time soon!)

I also had some prior experience with WebGL - plus the benefit of [WebGL2
Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/), a fantastic set of WebGL
tutorials.

# Twitter Development Log

If you would like to see more detail on the development process, I kept a
[Twitter thread going along the
way](https://twitter.com/NolanNicholson/status/1249873755444146176?s=20).

I hope you enjoy playing!
