    <p>
    I've been learning more about JavaScript and 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">the DOM</a> in particular,
    and I wanted to try out something to cement what I'd learned. To that end,
    I've created 
    <a href="gameoflife.html">
        an implementation of Conway's Game of Life</a>
    using nothing but vanilla JavaScript and CSS.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    (This is obviously not any kind of monumental achievement - 
    in fact, this is probably, like, implementation #4,920,110 of
    the Game of Life in Javascript - 
    but it was a fun project,
    and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in some quick practice in
    basic DOM traversal.
    </p>

    <h2>The game's basic rules</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">
        Conway's Game of Life</a>
    takes place on a grid of "cells" which can have two
    possible states - alive or dead. 
    The grid is periodically updated, and during these updates,
    cells will come alive or die based on the following rules:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Each cell has up to eight "neighbors" - the cells that are
            horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to it.
            These neighbors can be alive or dead.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a living cell has two or three neighbors, it stays alive.
            If it has fewer than two or more than three, it dies.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors, it comes alive.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    And that's all. From just those rules, you can get a dizzying variety of
    results and patterns - including a
    <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/271fall09/Turing-Machine-Life.pdf">Turing machine</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>How this implementation works</h2>
    <h3>Storing the grid in a table</h3>
    <p>
    The cells themselves are represented as <code>td</code> elements
    in an HTML table.
    Each cell is of either the class <code>alive</code> or the class
    <code>dead</code>, and those classes are used both to keep track of the
    cell's state in the script and to manage CSS formatting.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each cell also has an "age" class that can be either <code>age0</code>,
    <code>age1</code>, <code>age2</code>, or <code>age3</code>. This is
    outside the strict rules of the Game of Life and is purely a cosmetic
    thing: it's used to add CSS rules showing how long which cells recently
    came alive or died.
    </p>

    <p>
    The elements themselves are automatically added (both to avoid repetitive
    HTML entry, and to make the size of the grid easily adjustable):
    </p>

    <h3>Checking neighbors via DOM traversal</h3>
    <p>
    The most unusual part of using an HTML table for this is accessing
    each cell's neighbors to determine whether the cell must live or die.
    In most implementations of this game, the cell data would probably be
    stored in a matrix; then, checking the cell at
    <code>(x, y)</code> would be accomplished by looking up the cell at,
    say, <code>(x+1, y+1)</code>, for a diagonal neighbor. You could do this
    here, too! You could implement the grid's data as a matrix, and then pass
    that data to your HTML table to "draw" it.
    </p>

    <p>
    But if you're storing the data in a table anyway, then that opens up
    another method for checking the neighbors: DOM traversal! In particular,
    the methods 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NonDocumentTypeChildNode/previousElementSibling"><code>previousElementSibling</code></a>,
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NonDocumentTypeChildNode/nextElementSibling"><code>nextElementSibling</code></a>, and
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentElement"><code>parentElement</code></a>
    can work well here.
    </p>

    <p>
    The horizontal neighbors are the easiest to check, since they are located
    in the adjacent <code>td</code>elements, so they can be accessed by
    <code>previousElementSibling</code> and <code>nextElementSibling</code>.
    (If the cell being checked is at the left or right edge, then 
    there is no sibling, and the relevant one of these methods will just return
    <code>null</code> - which I interpret here as equivalent to "dead":
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('gameoflife.js', 26, 39) | safe }}

    <p>
    The other six neighbors are a little more complicated, since they're
    in different rows. There isn't really (as far as I know) an equivalent
    one-liner for "traverse to the <code>td</code> directly above this one."
    Instead, order to get to them, we have to first traverse to
    the parent row (the <code>tr</code> element) that contains our cell.
    Then, we use 
    <code>previousElementSibling</code> and <code>nextElementSibling</code> to
    get to the adjacent rows (where before we were traversing between cells.)
    </p>

    <p>
    Assuming the adjacent row isn't <code>null</code>, we then
    access the <code>td</code> elements inside it using its 
    <code>children</code> property. But <i>which</i> of the children do we
    look at? Even though we aren't using a matrix, we still need to know our
    X coordinate... but we can get it using <code>previousElementSibling</code>.
    How? We just call it repeatedly until it <code>null</code>s out:
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('gameoflife.js', 15, 24) | safe }}

    <p>
    With that, we can access the correct elements of the adjacent rows,
    which will be our vertically adjacent elements. We can also pick up
    the diagonally adjacent elements while we're at it.
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('gameoflife.js', 41, 59) | safe }}

    <h3>Finally, the Game of Life</h3>
    <p>
    Getting the number of living neighbors was the hard part. Once that is
    known, actually doing that whole Game of Life thing is easy!
    </p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
    One implementation detail I didn't quite figure out: if you
    <a href="gameoflife.html">fire it up</a> and try to draw on the grid,
    you can only do it one cell at a time.
    You can't click and drag multiple cells at
    once, which makes it a bit harder to draw in a pattern you want.
    Right now, clicking on the grid is implemented using
    the <code>mousedown</code> event:
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('gameoflife.js', 204, 205) | safe }}

    <p>
    But there might be a better event, or a better way to use it.
    If you know how I might improve this part of the experience, feel free to
    drop me a line!
