    <h2>Static Website Compilation</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="codesnippets.html">Last time</a>, I discussed some of the
    challenges of rendering code in a modern-looking webpage, using helpful
    features like syntax highlighting. The most immediately available solution,
    a JavaScript library from Google, yielded good-looking code, but it
    required a server call to Google and some JavaScript execution for a
    result that we know will be the same every time - and that would therefore
    be more efficient just to bake into the page HTML, if we can.
    As implemented, it also
    required us to put our code snippets in the HTML page itself, making it
    difficult to develop and test the code.
    </p>

    <p>
    This, it turns out, is symptomatic of a broader issue: there is a lot of
    "work" that is generally useful to be able to do automatically on HTML.
    Formatting code is just one example: it's also really useful to have things
    like page templating, so that much-reused components like headers and
    navigation bars don't have to be repeatedly copied and pasted.
    </p>

    <p>
    This task of programmatically modifying HTML is usually what
    JavaScript is for. But using JavaScript for these tasks
    means performing them every single time a
    user loads your page. If your page is viewed <i>n</i> times,
    then pre-formatting the HTML beforehand is an <i>O(1)</i> algorithm,
    where formatting the page using JavaScript is <i>O(n)</i>.
    The <i>n</i> executions just happen on other people's computers.
    </p>

    <p>
    So, I've just finished reorganizing my website to use
    <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> for automatic
    template compiling, and to perform some other automatic formatting (namely,
    syntax highlighting) through Python in the process. Jinja is a templating
    engine that dynamically generates HTML. It is most commonly
    used from within the web framework
    <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a>,
    to generate HTML for dynamic websites. But that doesn't mean it can't be
    used for static websites too! In this case, I just use the Flask app to
    get a context, in which I can save the results of Flask's render_template()
    function to a file:
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('compile.py', 27) | safe }}

    <p>
    Using Python to bake the HTML beforehand also has the side benefit of
    letting you load text from external files into your HTML - a task which
    is <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6348207/making-a-paragraph-in-html-contain-a-text-from-a-file>harder than one might think</a>
    to do at runtime, basically requiring either PHP or AJAX. Here, we can
    simply load it using Python and bake it right into the rendered HTML:
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('compile.py', 9, 22) | safe }}

    <p>
    With that defined, including external code in the template is as simple as:
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('snippet_template.html') | safe }}

    <p>
    Below is the full script that performs the templating.
    All of the page templates
    are stored in the library <code>templates</code>. They all
    extend a single template, <code>base.html</code>. Syntax highlighting is
    then performed using the Python library
    <a href="https://pygments.org">Pygments</a>.
    </p>

    {{ code_snippet('compile.py') | safe }}

    <p>
    Writing and hands-on development are done on the templates; then,
    a call to <code>python3 compile.py</code> puts together the "real" HTML
    files. I run this script manually, but I envision it could easily be
    worked into a CI workflow and done automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
    Fun fact: as of right now, the templates are still accessible on this
    site. This page, for example, is made from two templates:
    <a href="templates/base.html"><code>base.html</code></a> (for the
    formatting and objects common to all the pages on this site) and
    <a href="templates/pagerendering.html"><code>pagerendering.html</code></a>
    (for the content specific to this page.)
    But they are unrendered templates - so don't expect anything pretty!
    </p>

    <p>
    Overall, the result is quite maintainable,
    while still allowing a huge degree of
    freedom (you can still just specify a page's HTML completely from scratch
    with no templating and just pass it through, if you want to),
    and it performs all of the "busy work"
    just once - instead of delegating it to JavaScript on the reader's side,
    on every single page load. This idea isn't necessarily specific to
    purely static websites either; it could be used to lessen the redundant
    work done by a web server, or simply to help reduce load times by
    trimming some JavaScript fat.
    </p>

    <p>
    I hope this is helpful! I made it in part because I didn't see a solution
    out there for avoiding some of the busy work of static website composition
    while still staying close to simple, clean HTML. (That second part
    disqualified full-fledged CMS's like WordPress and Medium.) But if there
    is such a solution I missed, please drop me a line -
    I'd love to know about it, and
    I'd still be happy to have gotten the experience putting this together.
    </p>
