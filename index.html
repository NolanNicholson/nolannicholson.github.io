    <p>I'm Nolan, a chemical process engineer living in Sacramento, CA.
      I work for <a href='http://originmaterials.com/'>Origin Materials</a>,
      a chemical R&D and manufacturing startup in West Sacramento.</p>
    <p>I earned a B.S. in chemical engineering from the University of Nevada,
      Reno. I had a minor in business administration, and participated in the
      Entrepreneurship Club and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.
    <p>I research and practice computer programming and artificial intelligence
      as hobbies, and hope to incorporate them more and more into my professional work.</p>
    <p>I also really enjoy the Chinese and Japanese languages. While a student at UNR,
      I spent a summer in Suzhou, Jiangsu as a student in the US Department
      of State's Critical Language Scholarship.</p>
    <p>There isn't a whole lot of content on this website yet. I'm posting this
      here mainly so I have an excuse to use this github.io site.
      Although the Internet has been a thing since well before I was born, it's
      still absolutely magical to me that you can post something where it's
      accessible by the whole world, and I'm quite grateful to GitHub for
      allowing me to do so, free of charge.</p>
